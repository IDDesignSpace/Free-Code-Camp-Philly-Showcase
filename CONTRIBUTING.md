Thank you for considering contributing to "The Free Code Camp Philly Showcase"
===================
# Contributing Guidelines #

## About this project ##

We value and encourage the community to provide contributions and feedback on how we can make the showcase more aesthetically pleasing or more fun to use.

We value creating a positive place to learn about coding and contributing to open source software.  If you want to contribute but aren’t confident in your abilities to do so, we are more than happy to work with you and won’t get mad if you make mistakes.

The project is created using React. Rather than rely on an admin system, new content is added through pull requests. 

We use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/tutordelphia/Free-Code-Camp-Philly-Showcase/issues) to track our issues. One can see the progress made on a particular issue and the discussion on any issues. All contributions and commits first start out as issues on the tracker. New commits reference the issue number (for example "add the new feature from issue #12").

### How does it work?

Members of Free Code Camp Philly will add their personal and Free Code Camp porfolio info (name, project urls, project descriptions) to a json object. The React frontend loops through the json data and displays their profiles and porfolios (as long as the links to the portfolios are currently working).


## Contributing Code ##

If you want to contribute code, we suggest you to fork the repository first, select an issue, make your changes and submit a pull request for that issue. You can suggest new features, fix an existing functionality for performance or readability, work on open issues, etc. If the contribution will take you a significant amount of time, check in with current contributors on the issues page first. We want to be respectful of your time.

Key areas of code contributions include:
- Adding your portfolio!
- Writing Copy (writing text for the web page) and branding (such as choosing color scheme)
- New features
- Documentation
- Styling

When working on an issue, see if the update/fix already has a pending. 

When creating a pull request, if it applies, close or link to the issue it resolves in your comments. See [GitHubs documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) on how to do this.

## Current Status ##

The project is just getting started. We are not in a rush to complete this project because we feel a lot can be learned from the journey and we want a large group of people to have the opportunity to contribute.
